# GorillaAvatarCatalog
A cosmetic mod for Gorilla Tag allowing for simple avatar loading and saving functionality

## History
GorillaAvatarCatalog was initially conceptualized near the official launch of Gorilla Tag, that would be around December 2022. This is also around the time I began working on a revolutionary cosmetic masterpiece that you probably haven't heard of before; GorillaShirts. During this time, GorillaAvatarCatalog was given the name CosmeticsPlus (stylized as Cosmetics+).

Here's a screenshot of that initial prototype, dug up from the Dev's Dungeon archives:

This particular build of the mod is dated December 29, 2022. It was simple, and kept to six total buttons, half for loading your avatar, and half for saving your avatar. An entire day later, the mod was expanded, adding manual buttons for loading and saving data from your drive, and don't forget the additional button added for loading/saving.

Here's a screenshot of the second revision of the mod, one day after the first:

As to what happened after these two prototype builds, I can't say I remember. I'm certain they were used for at least a couple months after, proved by a minor patch made in Feburary that year.

During and leading up to the release of the aforementioned GorillaShirts, I experimented with giving out entire mods to members willing to support my Discord server or myself finantially. This eventually lead to be publishing a new mod, "GorillaOutfitCatalog". I'm certain that the mod was nearly a replica if not the exact same as Cosmetics+, but I can be wrong, my mind is especially foggy around this part.. 

Did I mention the idea of being able to save avatars (name, colour, and cosmetics) was an idea I thought only once every couple months after it's initial prototype? You know, that's probably why I can't remember much about the development of this revision, there was little to none! Anyway, that brings us to today, when the idea came to my head to completely revise the mod after a popular fix of it began gaining additional traction by players who really seemed to dig this sort of mod.

Introducing, GorillaAvatarCatalog!! Yup, it's the mod you've all been waiting for, with your favourite loading and saving mechanics, automatic retriving of avatars from your drive, and (mostly) unlimited avatars!

Navigate to utilizing avatars using either of their buttons accessible at any wardrobe in the game. With this mod, you can quickly swap out of your avatars in seconds, from complete avatar rehauls to small silly changes, personally I prefer the latter, just look at what I've made:

Okay, these examples are leaning on the more, eh, lacklustre side. If you see by chance find me in-game, I'd be happy to throw in your transformations here!

I have the Wolf Ears, Face Scarf, Vampire Collar, Wolf Claws, Turkey Leg, Black Umbrella, and often seen with either the Croptop or my own turtleneck:
